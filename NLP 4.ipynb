    "Sequence models are the machine learning models that input or output sequences of data. Sequential data includes text streams, audio clips, video clips, time-series data and etc. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is a popular algorithm used in sequence models. Applications of Sequence Models 1. Speech recognition:In speech recognition, an audio clip is given as an input and then the model has to generate its text transcript"
